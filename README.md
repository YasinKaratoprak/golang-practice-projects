#  Golang Practise Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of Go (Golang) practice projects.  
This repository documents my learning journey through practical mini-projects as I study the fundamentals of the Go programming language.

##  Purpose

I’m learning Go by **building instead of just reading**.  
Each project here is directly inspired by what I’ve learned from the book **Head First Go** by Jay McGavren, and covers specific topics in a hands-on way.

##  What You'll Find Here

Each subfolder contains:
- A **self-contained Go project**
- Clean and commented code
- Concepts it demonstrates
- Basic input/output interaction via CLI
